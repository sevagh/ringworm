Two ringbuffers written in Go.

[ringbuffer1](./ringbuffer-bytes) stores bytes. It implements an indexing strategy learned from https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-12-13-ring-buffers/

[ringbuffer2](./ringbuffer-interfaces) stores interfaces. The API is inspired by https://github.com/armon/circbuf
